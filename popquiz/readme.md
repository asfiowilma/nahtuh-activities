## How to play

### TL;DR

- As host: build your question set, share the URL or game ID to your players, and start the quiz! 
- As player: enter the game ID, answer the question, and win! 

### As Host

- Create a new room and enter your username. 

- Build your question set by adding questions (don't forget to click save!)

- Choose one of three question types:

  - Multiple choice: players are given four options to choose from, there is only one correct answer.
  - True of False: players are given two options (normally true or false, but these can be changed), there is one correct answer.
  - Short Answer: players are to type their own answer, there may be multiple versions of the correct answer.

- Choose the time limit to answer each question. The player cannot answer after the time is up.

- Choose point rewards for each question: 

  - Default: players are rewarded 200 base points for any correct answer and additional time-bonus points up to 200, with a maximum total of 400 points for each question. 

  - Double Points: same calculations as above, multiplied 2x with a maximum total of 800 points for each question.
  - No Points: players will not be rewarded any points for answering this question.   

- Host can import/export the question set as JSON file to use again for later. 

- When everything is set up, click **START** to start accepting players.

- Share the link/gameID provided on the platform/screen so players can join the room. When everyone is ready, click **Start Quiz**.

  - For **Short Answer** types, the players' wrong answers will be displayed. The host may mark close answers as correct, and the player will be rewarded points as normal.
