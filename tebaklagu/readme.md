## How to play

### TL;DR

- As host: build your question set, share the URL or game ID to your players, and start the quiz! 
- As player: enter the game ID, listen to the audio clue, answer the question and win! 

### As Host

- Create a new room and enter your username. 
- Build your question set by adding questions (don't forget to click save!)
- Choose one of two question types:

  - Music Video: insert a youtube URL and set the start and duration time. The video will play (but not displayed) from the start time (time in seconds since the start of the video) for as long as the duration (in seconds).
  - Text-to-Speech: paste some lyrics to the input and choose a robot voice to read it.
- Choose the time limit to answer each question. The player cannot answer after the time is up (except if **Manual Reveal** setting is turned on).
  - For Music Video type, the time limit is separate from duration. Total time limit is question time limit + set duration of MV. 
- Choose point rewards for each question: 

  - Default: players are rewarded 200 base points for any correct answer and additional time-bonus points up to 200, with a maximum total of 400 points for each question. 

  - Double Points: same calculations as above, multiplied 2x with a maximum total of 800 points for each question.
  - No Points: players will not be rewarded any points for answering this question.   
- Host can import/export the question set as JSON file to use again for later. 
- **Additional Settings:**
  - Autoplay: the audio will start upon page render. If not turned on, host will manually press the **Play** button to play audio and start the timer. 
  - Audio only on host: the audio will not play on the players' browser. This is ideal if the host is sharing their screen. If not turned on, every player can hear the audio from their browser (depends heavily on their internet connection).
  - Manual reveal: the players may answer even if the time is up until the host decide to reveal the answer. The player can still get points from answering correctly, but no time-bonus. If not turned on, answer will be revealed as soon as the time is up. 
- When everything is set up, click **START** to start accepting players.
- Share the link/gameID provided on the platform/screen so players can join the room. When everyone is ready, click **Start Quiz**.
- The screen will display questions entered from before. `Clicking Next here will skip the current question and move on to the next.`
- After the time is up, the correct answer will be revealed and the top 5 players with the most points are displayed. Click **Next** to continue to the next question. 

  - For **Short Answer** type, the players' wrong answers will be displayed. The host may mark close answers as correct, and the player will be rewarded points as normal. 
- When the question set is over, the final leaderboard and the overall winner will be shown.

### As Player

- Enter the Game ID given by your host and a username to enter the quiz room. Wait for the host to start quiz. 
- Listen to the audio clue and answer the questions by typing in the input bar. 
- Click **Submit** or enter to answer. The faster you answer, the bigger your point rewards.
- Answer as many questions and be the winner!
